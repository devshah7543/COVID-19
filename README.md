## COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis and Prediction Dashboard Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and developing predictive models to forecast future trends in COVID-19 cases. The primary objective is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive tool for visualizing, analyzing, and predicting the spread and effects of COVID-19 across different regions.

#### Key Features
- Advanced Data Analytics: Detailed analysis of COVID-19 data, including case numbers, mortality rates, and recovery rates.
- Predictive Modeling: Robust models to forecast future trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Interactive Visualizations: User-friendly charts and graphs for enhanced data exploration.

#### Data Sources
The data used in this project was sourced from the Our World in Data COVID-19 Deaths dataset, which provides comprehensive global data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and related statistics.

#### Data Processing
- Data Cleaning and Exploration: Performed using SQL and MySQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Data Export and Import: Cleaned data was exported from MySQL and imported into Tableau for visualization.

#### Dashboards Created
The following dashboards were developed in Tableau:

- Global Case Trends: Interactive time-series plots showing the progression of COVID-19 cases worldwide.
- Regional Comparisons: Heatmaps and bar charts comparing the impact of COVID-19 across different regions.
- Predictive Trends: Trend lines forecasting future COVID-19 case numbers based on historical data.
- Mortality and Recovery Analysis: Visualizations highlighting mortality and recovery rates globally and regionally.

#### How to Explore the Dashboard
To explore the dashboard and gain actionable insights:

  1. Clone the Repository: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the Dashboard File: Use Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader to open the .twbx dashboard file located in the repository.
    - Explore the Charts and Tables: Interact with the visualizations to understand COVID-19 trends and predictions.
  3. You can download the dataset.zip, in which you can find 3 '.csv' files, the dataset.csv is the main dataset, and the other 2 are files modified from dataset.csv to perform SQL exploration
  4. You can use both files to explore data using SQL and also download the SQL file with queries named "COVID Data Exploration.sql"
  5. Then, after exploration, new 4 '.csv' files were created for Tableau Exploration

#### Technical Details
- Languages and Tools: SQL, MySQL, Tableau
- Predictive Modeling Techniques: Time-series analysis, machine learning algorithms
- Visualizations: Time-series plots, heatmaps, trend lines, bar charts
